# **Ethereum’s Proof of Stake: The Upgrade That Changed Everything (And Almost Didn’t Happen)**  

Ethereum’s switch to proof of stake (PoS) was always the plan. If you go back to Vitalik’s early blog posts or the Ethereum whitepaper, it’s right there - proof of work (PoW) was never meant to last. The Merge was supposed to happen **years ago**.  

But here’s the thing: Ethereum grew faster than anyone expected. By 2020, **Ethereum was too big to experiment on**. You don’t just flip the switch on a live chain running **billions of dollars in DeFi, NFTs, and infrastructure** without breaking something.  

Yet, somehow, **it worked**. On September 15, 2022, Ethereum **shut down mining forever**, moved to proof of stake, and almost nobody noticed. No downtime. No forked chain war. No panic. Just *business as usual*.  

But why did Ethereum need to make the switch in the first place?

## **Why Ethereum Had to Ditch Proof of Work**  

Everyone likes to talk about **how much electricity mining wastes** - and Ethereum was burning as much energy as **the Netherlands** just to validate transactions. But the bigger issue?  

**Mining wasn’t making Ethereum more secure. It was just making it more expensive.**  

### **The Real Problems with PoW**  

- **Mining was centralizing fast.** By 2021, just **five mining pools** controlled **over 65% of Ethereum’s hashrate**. That’s a handful of companies, mostly in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia, with all the power to decide what transactions made it into blocks. Decentralized? Not really.  
- **Miners were dumping ETH daily.** Ethereum was issuing **13,000 ETH per day** to miners, and guess what? Most of it was getting sold immediately to cover electricity and hardware costs. This put constant downward pressure on ETH’s price.  
- **It was a bad deal for Ethereum.** Ethereum was paying billions per year in new ETH just to keep the network secure. Meanwhile, proof of stake could **do the same job for 90% less**.  

If Ethereum was going to scale into **a global financial settlement layer**, it needed a better security model—one that didn’t depend on an arms race of **more GPUs and more electricity**.

## **How Proof of Stake Actually Works (And Why It’s Better)**  

Ethereum **ditched miners** and replaced them with **validators**—users who **stake 32 ETH** as collateral to secure the network. Instead of burning energy, PoS relies on economic incentives:  

- **If you validate correctly, you earn ETH.**  
- **If you try to cheat, you lose ETH.**  

This shifts Ethereum’s security from **computational power** to **economic penalties**. Instead of spending millions on mining rigs, an attacker now needs to buy up a majority of the staked ETH - which would cost tens of billions of dollars and destroy the very asset they’re trying to manipulate.  

### **More reasons PoS works better:**  

- **99.95% energy savings.** Ethereum now runs on as much energy as a small town instead of an entire country.  
- **No more miner dumping.** With PoW, Ethereum was constantly inflating its supply. Post-Merge? ETH issuance dropped **by 90%**, and thanks to EIP-1559, **more ETH is burned than created**—making Ethereum deflationary over time.  
- **Stronger security at a lower cost.** PoS doesn’t need to pay miners billions per year just to stay secure. It uses **financial penalties** instead of wasted electricity.

## **The Merge: What Actually Changed?**  

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum’s **consensus layer switched from PoW to PoS**. That’s it. No change to gas fees. No faster transactions (yet). Just **a full-on security model swap with no downtime**.  

### **Immediate effects:**  

- **Ethereum’s energy usage dropped by 99.95%.** The single biggest reduction in blockchain energy consumption, ever.  
- **ETH issuance dropped from 13,000 ETH/day to 1,600 ETH/day.** Less new ETH in circulation = stronger long-term price action.  
- **Ethereum became deflationary.** Thanks to EIP-1559’s burn mechanism, more ETH is being burned than issued.  

Did gas fees drop? **No.**  
Did transactions get faster? **Also no.**  
But did Ethereum become **cheaper to run, more secure, and better positioned for future upgrades?** **Yes.**  

And that’s the key here — The Merge wasn’t **the final destination**. It was **step one** in Ethereum’s long-term evolution.

## **What’s Next for Ethereum?**  

Proof of stake made Ethereum **more efficient**, but it didn’t make it **cheaper or faster**. That’s why **scalability is the next big push**.  

Ethereum’s future depends on **Layer 2 scaling**, which is already happening with rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. But rollups still cost money to use, because they need to store data on Ethereum.  

### **That’s where Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) comes in.**  

This is **the biggest Ethereum upgrade happening in 2024**, and it’s going to **cut rollup fees by 10x or more**. Here’s how:  

- Right now, rollups post all their transaction data **on-chain**, which is expensive.  
- EIP-4844 introduces **Blob Transactions**, a new way to store rollup data **cheaply and temporarily** instead of permanently clogging Ethereum’s state.  
- Less data stored on Ethereum = **cheaper rollup fees** = **cheaper transactions for users**.  

We’re talking L2 transactions for **a few cents instead of a few dollars**.  

### **Beyond that?**  

- **Single-Slot Finality** – Transactions will finalize instantly, no more waiting multiple blocks.  
- **Verkle Trees & Stateless Clients** – Running an Ethereum node will get **way easier**, increasing decentralization.  
- **Restaking with EigenLayer** – The ability to stake ETH *again* for additional security layers, bringing more utility to Ethereum staking.  

Proof of stake wasn’t the end of Ethereum’s evolution. It was the foundation for **everything coming next**.

## **Final Thoughts**  

If The Merge proved one thing, it’s that **Ethereum can upgrade itself without breaking**.  

Bitcoiners will tell you blockchains need to be static, but Ethereum just rewrote its entire consensus mechanism **without a hard fork, without losing any security, and without disrupting users**. That’s insane.  

And Ethereum isn’t done.  

The real upgrades — **cheap transactions, instant finality, and even more decentralization** — are still ahead. If you think The Merge was the biggest change Ethereum will ever make, you haven’t been paying attention.  

The network is **just getting started**.
